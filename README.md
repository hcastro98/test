When you’re ready to commit your work, you need to let Git know which files it should include in the commit, using the ‘git add’ command.
When you ‘git add’ a file, you’re telling Git to add this file to a staging area, which is like a loading dock where you pick and choose
which files are going to be shipped to GitHub. All new files, and any existing files you’ve updated, must be “staged,” before you can commit
them to GitHub.
